    <h1>CO-VID19</h1>
    <p title="intro">Respond and protect: With COVID-19 now reported in almost all Gavi-eligible countries, the <br> Alliance is providing immediate funding to health systems, enabling countries<br> to protect health care workers, perform vital surveillance and training, and purchase diagnostic tests.

        Maintain, restore and strengthen: Gavi will support countries to adapt and restart immunisation services,<br> rebuild community trust and catch up those who have been missed both before <br>and during the pandemic, while also investing in strengthening immunisation systems to be more resilient<br> and responsive to the communities they serve.</p>
